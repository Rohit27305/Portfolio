## Step 1: Code Quality with SonarCloud

> **Goal:**  
> Detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells early in the development cycle.

**How it's done:**
1. **Connect SonarCloud to GitHub:**  
   - Set up a SonarCloud project and link your repository.
2. **Add a GitHub Actions Workflow:**  
   - Place a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml`) in your repository.
3. **Automate Quality Checks:**  
   - On every push or pull request, the workflow:
     - Builds the code
     - Runs tests
     - Uploads results to SonarCloud
4. **Enforce Quality Gates:**  
   - Prevent merging PRs that fail code quality checks.

> ```
> [Benefit] Continuous feedback, reduced technical debt, and improved code quality.
> ```

## Step 2: Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

> **Goal:**  
> Ensure every change is automatically built, tested, and deployed.

**How it's done:**
1. **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines:**  
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate the process.
2. **On Every Push to `main`:**
   - Build Docker images for both services.
   - Run unit and integration tests.
   - Push images to a container registry (Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry).
   - Deploy to Kubernetes using Helm.
3. **Manage Secrets Securely:**  
   - Store credentials in GitHub Secrets.

> ```
> [Benefit] Fast, reliable, and repeatable deployments with minimal manual intervention.
> ```

## Step 3: Dockerization of Both Services

> **Goal:**  
> Package both services for consistent deployment across all environments.

**How it's done:**
1. **Create a `Dockerfile` for Each Service:**  
   - Define dependencies, build steps, and entrypoints.
2. **Use Multi-Stage Builds:**  
   - Optimize image size and security.
3. **Tag Images:**  
   - Use commit SHA or version numbers for traceability.
4. **Push Images:**  
   - Upload to a container registry as part of CI/CD.

> ```
> [Benefit] Consistent environments, easy rollbacks, and version control.
> ```

## Step 4: Kubernetes Deployment with Helm

> **Goal:**  
> Achieve secure, scalable, and zero-downtime deployments.

**How it's done:**
1. **Create a Helm Chart:**  
   - Define Kubernetes manifests for both services.
2. **Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**  
   - Use `ServiceAccount`, `Role`, and `RoleBinding` for least-privilege access.
3. **Enable Autoscaling (HPA):**  
   - Automatically scale pods based on CPU or memory usage.
4. **Configure Rolling Updates:**  
   - Use the `RollingUpdate` strategy for zero downtime.
   - Set max surge and unavailable pods for smooth updates.

> ```
> [Benefit] Enhanced security, scalability, and seamless updates.
> ```

---

## Step 5: Networking with Ingress

> **Goal:**  
> Expose both services securely and efficiently to the outside world.

**How it's done:**
1. **Define Ingress Resource in Helm Chart:**  
   - Centralize routing for all services.
2. **Configure Routing Rules:**  
   - Route traffic based on path or host.
3. **Enable TLS Termination:**  
   - Provide secure HTTPS access.
4. **Optional: Integrate with DNS & Cert-Manager:**  
   - Automate certificate management and DNS updates.

> ```
> [Benefit] Centralized, secure, and manageable external access.
> ```
